ArangoRB [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/arangorb.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/arangorb)
===============================

[ArangoDatabase](https://www.arangodb.com/) is a native multi-model database with flexible data models for document, graphs, and key-values.
ArangoRB is a Gem to use ArangoDatabase with Ruby. ArangoRB is based on the [HTTP API of ArangoDB](https://docs.arangodb.com/3.0/HTTP/index.html).

ArangoRB has been tested with ArangoDatabase 3.0 on Ruby 2.3.1. It requires the gem "HTTParty"

To install ArangoRB: `gem install arangorb`

To use it in your application: `require "arangorb"`

This Gem was created from [Seluxit ApS](http://seluxit.com/).

## ArangoServer

ArangoServer is used to manage the default Database, Collection, User and Graph.
It is used to give your login credentials and it is the mandatory step to start your database.
Further it helps to manage the Server connected with ArangoDB.

To setup your credentials use:

``` ruby
ArangoServer.default_server user: "MyUsername", password: "MyPassword", server: "localhost", port: "8529"
```

If not declared, the default values are user: "root", password: "", server: "localhost", port: "8529".

### Default variables

Databases, Graphs and Collections used in your program can be defined each time. But often it is convenient to have some default one.
If this is the case, the user can use ArangoServer to define some default values.

``` ruby
ArangoServer.database = "MyDatabase" # Setup default Database
ArangoServer.graph = "MyGraph" # Setup default Graph
ArangoServer.collection = "MyCollection" # Setup default Collection
ArangoServer.user = "MyUser"  # Setup default User
```

By default the default database is "\_system".

### Verbose

For Debugging reasons the user can receive the original JSON file from the database by setting verbose on true (false by default).

``` ruby
ArangoServer.verbose = true
```

Remember that verbose is only for testing reason: to work efficiently verbose should be false.

### Information

Basic informations can be retrieved with these command.

``` ruby
ArangoServer.database # Check name default Database
ArangoServer.graph   # Check name default Graph
ArangoServer.collection  # Check name default Collection
ArangoServer.user  # Check name default User
ArangoServer.address  # Check address used to connect with the server
ArangoServer.username  # Check name used to connect with the server
ArangoServer.verbose # Check if verbose is true or false
ArangoServer.async # Check the status of async
ArangoServer.request # Check the default request sent to the server
```

To retrieve lists

``` ruby
ArangoServer.endpoints # Lists of endpoints used
ArangoServer.users # Lists of available users
ArangoServer.databases # Lists of available databases
ArangoServer.tasks # Lists of available tasks
```

To monitoring the server you can use the following commands

``` ruby
ArangoServer.log # Return log files
ArangoServer.reload # Reloads the routing information from the collection routing.
ArangoServer.statistics # Returns the statistics information
ArangoServer.statistics description: true # Fetch descriptive info of statistics
ArangoServer.role # Get to know whether this server is a Coordinator or DB-Server
ArangoServer.serverId # Fetch this servers uniq identifier
```

### Manage Async

With ArangoServer you can manage Async results.

``` ruby
ArangoServer.async = false # default
ArangoServer.async = true # fire and forget
ArangoServer.async = "store" # fire and store
```

If Async is "store", then the commands of ArangoRB will return the id of the Async requests.
ArangoServer provides different methods to manage these Async requests.

``` ruby
ArangoServer.pendingAsync # Querying the status of a pending job
ArangoServer.fetchAsync id: id # Fetches a job result and removes it from the queue
ArangoServer.retrieveAsync id: id # Returns the status of a specific job
ArangoServer.retrieveAsync type: type # Returns the ids of job results with a specific status
# Type can be "done" or "pending"
ArangoServer.retrieveDoneAsync # Equivalent to ArangoServer.retrieveAsync type: "done"
ArangoServer.retrievePendingAsync # Equivalent to ArangoServer.retrieveAsync type: "pending"
ArangoServer.cancelAsync id: id # Cancels an async job
ArangoServer.destroyAsync id: id # Deletes an async job result
ArangoServer.destroyAsync type: type # Deletes async jobs with a specific status
# Type can be "all" or "expired"
ArangoServer.destroyAllAsync # Equivalent to ArangoServer.destroyAsync type: "all"
ArangoServer.destroyExpiredAsync # Equivalent to ArangoServer.destroyAsync type: "expired"
```

### Batch

ArangoDB offers a batch request API that clients can use to send multiple operations in one batch to ArangoDB. To manage it you can use the following way.

``` ruby
queries = [
  {
    "type": "POST",
    "address": "/_db/MyDatabase/_api/collection",
    "body": {"name": "newCOLLECTION"},
    "id": "1"
  },
  {
    "type": "GET",
    "address": "/_api/database",
    "id": "2"
  }
]
ArangoServer.batch queries: queries
```

To manage these batch, ArangoServer offers the following functions:

``` ruby
ArangoServer.createDumpBatch ttl: 10 # Create a new dump batch with 10 second time-to-live (return id of the dumpBatch)
ArangoServer.prolongDumpBatch id: idDumpBatch, ttl: 20 # Prolong the life of a batch for 20 seconds
ArangoServer.destroyDumpBatch id: idDumpBatch # Delete a selected batch
```

### Miscellaneous

``` ruby
ArangoServer.version # Returns the server version number
ArangoServer.flushWAL # Flushes the write-ahead log
ArangoServer.propertyWAL # Retrieves the configuration of the write-ahead log
ArangoServer.changePropertyWAL # Configures the write-ahead log
ArangoServer.transactions # Returns information about the currently running transactions
ArangoServer.time # Get the current time of the system
ArangoServer.echo # Return current request
ArangoServer.databaseVersion # Return the required version of the database
ArangoServer.sleep duration: 10 # Sleep for a specified amount of seconds
ArangoServer.shutdown # Initiate shutdown sequence
ArangoServer.restart # Restart ArangoDB (requires administration access)
```

UNTESTED

``` ruby
ArangoServer.test body: body # Runs tests on server
ArangoServer.execute body: body # Execute a script on the server.
```

### Sharding (UNTESTED)

ArangoDB permits the sharding of the database. Although these methods has not been tested with ArangoRB.

``` ruby
ArangoServer.cluster # Default cluster
ArangoServer.getCluster body: body, cluster: cluster # Retrieve cluster
ArangoServer.executeCluster body: body, cluster: cluster # Execute cluster
ArangoServer.executeClusterPut body: body, cluster: cluster # Execute cluster
ArangoServer.executeClusterHead body: body, cluster: cluster # Execute cluster
ArangoServer.destroyCluster cluster: cluster # Delete cluster
ArangoServer.updateCluster body: body, cluster: cluster # Update cluster
ArangoServer.checkPort port: port # Allows to check whether a given port is usable
ArangoServer.server # Returns the id of a server in a cluster.
ArangoServer.clusterStatistics dbserver: dbserver # Allows to query the statistics of a DBserver in the cluster
```

## ArangoDatabase

ArangoDatabase is used to manage your Database. You can create an instance in the following way:

``` ruby
myDatabase = ArangoDatabase.new database: "MyDatabase"
```

Alternatively, you can use the default values provided by ArangoServer:

``` ruby
ArangoServer.database = "MyDatabase"
myDatabase = ArangoDatabase.new
```

### Create and Destroy a Database

``` ruby
myDatabase.create # Create a new Database
myDatabase.destroy # Delete the selected Database
```

### Retrieve information

``` ruby
ArangoDatabase.info # Obtain general info about the databases
ArangoDatabase.databases # Obtain an Array with the available databases
myDatabase.collections # Obtain an Array with the available collections in the selected Database
myDatabase.graphs #  Obtain an Array with the available graphs in the selected Database
myDatabase.functions #  Obtain an Array with the available functions in the selected Database
```

It is possible to access its Collections and Graphs by their ids.

``` ruby
myDatabase["MyCollection"].retrieve # where "MyCollection" is the id of the collection
myDatabase.collection("MyCollection").retrieve
myDatabase.graph("MyGraph").retrieve
```


### Query

ArangoDatabase instances can manage the queries used in their Database.

``` ruby
myDatabase.propertiesQuery; # See property of the Query
myDatabase.currentQuery; # Check the current Query
myDatabase.slowQuery; # Find slow queries
myDatabase.stopSlowQuery; # Stop slow queries
myDatabase.kill query: myQuery # Kill a Query
myDatabase.changePropertiesQuery maxSlowQueries: 65 # Change properties of a Query
```

### Cache

To manage the cache ArangoDatabase provides the following three functions.

``` ruby
myDatabase.clearCache # Clear Cache
myDatabase.propertyCache # Check properties Cache
myDatabase.changePropertyCache maxResults: 30 # Change properties Cache
```

### AQL Functions

``` ruby
myDatabase.createFunction code: "function(){return 1+1;}", name: "myFunction" # Create a new Function
myDatabase.deleteFunction name: "myFunction" # Delete a function
myDatabase.functions # Retrieve a list of the available functions
```

### User

You can manage the right of a user to access the database.

``` ruby
myDatabase.grant user: myUser # Grant access to database
myDatabase.revoke user: myUser # Revoke access to database
```

<a name="ArangoCollection"></a>
## ArangoCollection

ArangoDatabase is used to manage your Collections. You can create an ArangoCollection instance in one of the following way:

``` ruby
myCollection = ArangoCollection.new database: "MyDatabase", collection: "MyCollection"
myCollection = ArangoCollection.new collection: "MyCollection"  # Using the default database
myCollection = ArangoCollection.new # Using the default database and collection
```

A Collection can be of two types: "Document" and "Edge". If you want to specify it, uses:

``` ruby
myCollectionA = ArangoCollection.new collection: "MyCollectionA", type: "Document"
myCollectionB = ArangoCollection.new collection: "MyCollectionB", type: "Edge"
```

### Create a Collection

`myCollection.create`

If not specified the default type of the Collection is "Document".
To create an Edge Collection you can use one of the next three options:

``` ruby
myCollection.create_edge_collection
myCollection.create type: "Edge"
myCollectionB = ArangoCollection.new collection: "MyCollectionB", type: "Edge";  myCollectionB.create
```

### Destroy or Truncate a Collections

Destroy will delete the selected Collection from the Database.

`myCollection.destroy`

Truncate will delete all the Documents inside the selected Collection.

`myCollection.truncate`

### Retrieve information

It is possible to access its Documents and its database.

``` ruby
myCollection["MyDocument"]
myDatabase.document("MyDocument")
myDatabase.database
```

For other information

``` ruby
myCollection.retrieve # Retrieve the selected Collection
myCollection.indexes # Return a list of all used Indexes in the Collection
myCollection.data # Returns the whole content of one collection
myCollection.properties # Properties of the Collection
myCollection.count # Number of Documents in the Collection
myCollection.stats # Statistics of the Collection
myCollection.revision # Return collection revision id
myCollection.checksum # Return checksum for the Collection
```

To retrieve all the documents of a Collection you can use:

``` ruby
myCollection.documents
myCollection.allDocuments
```

These two functions are similar except for the fact that you can assign different variables.

`myCollection.documents type: "path"`

Type can be "path", "id" or "key" in relation what we wish to have. If not specified we will receive an array of ArangoDocument instances.

`myCollection.allDocuments skip: 3, limit: 100, batchSize: 10`

It means that we skip the first three Documents, we can retrieve the next 100 Documents but we return only the first ten.

To retrieve specific Document you can use:

``` ruby
myCollection.documentsMatch match: {"value" => 4} # All Documents of the Collection with value equal to 4
myCollection.documentMatch match: {"value" => 4} # The first Document of the Collection with value equal to 4
myCollection.documentByKeys keys: ["4546", "4646"] # Documents of the Collection with the keys in the Array
myCollection.random # A random Document of the Collection
```

### Modify the Collection

``` ruby
myCollection.load # Load the Collection
myCollection.unload  # Unload the Collection
myCollection.change waitForSync: true  # Change a property of the Collection
myCollection.rename "myCollectionC"  # Rename the Collection
myCollection.rotate # Rotate journal of a collection
```

### Import and Export Documents

For the standard way to import one or more Documents (or Edges) we refer to the [dedicated ArangoDocument section](#create_doc).
However it is possible to import a huge quantity of documents in a Collection with only one requests with the command import.

<strong>Import one Document with Array</strong>
I import one document with the following structure {"value": "uno", "num": 1, "name": "ONE"}.
``` ruby
attributes = ["value", "num", "name"]
values = ["uno",1,"ONE"]
myCollection.import attributes: attributes, values: values
```

<strong>Import more Documents with Array</strong>
I import three Documents with the following structure {"value": "uno", "num": 1, "name": "ONE"}, {"value": "due", "num": 2, "name": "TWO"}, {"value": "tre", "num": 3, "name": "THREE"}.
``` ruby
attributes = ["value", "num", "name"]
values = [["uno",1,"ONE"],["due",2,"TWO"],["tre",3,"THREE"]]
myCollection.import attributes: attributes, values: values
```

<strong>Import more Documents with JSON</strong>
I import two Documents with the following structure {"value": "uno", "num": 1, "name": "ONE"}, {"value": "due", "num": 2, "name": "TWO"}.
``` ruby
body = [{"value": "uno", "num": 1, "name": "ONE"}, {"value": "due", "num": 2, "name": "DUE"}]
myCollection.importJSON body: body
```

As it is possible to import files, it is possible to export all the Document of a Collection with the following command.
``` ruby
myCollection.export
```

Alternatively it is possible to retrieve all the Documents in a Collection gradually.

``` ruby
myCollection.export batchSize: 3 # First three Documents of the Collection
myCollection.exportNext # Next three Documents
myCollection.exportNext # Next three Documents
```

### Other operations

``` ruby
myCollection.removeByKeys keys: ["4546", "4646"] # Documents of the Collection with the keys in the Array will be removed
myCollection.removeMatch match: {"value" => 4} # All Documents of the Collection with value equal to 4 will be removed
myCollection.replaceMatch match: {"value" => 4}, newValue: {"value" => 6} # All Documents of the Collection with value equal to 4 will be replaced with the new Value
myCollection.updateMatch match: {"value" => 4}, newValue: {"value" => 6} # All Documents of the Collection with value equal to 4 will be updated with the new Value
```

<a name="ArangoDocument"></a>
## ArangoDocument

An Arango Document is an element of a Collection. Edges are documents with "\_from" and "\_to" in their body.
You can create an ArangoCollection instance in one of the following way:

``` ruby
myDocument = ArangoDocument.new database: "MyDatabase", collection: "MyCollection", key: "myKey"
myDocument = ArangoDocument.new collection: "MyCollection", key: "myKey"  # Using default Database
myDocument = ArangoDocument.new key: "myKey" # Using default Collection and Database
myDocument = ArangoDocument.new #  Using default Collection and Database and I don't want to define a key for my Instance
```

In the case you want to define a Edge, it is convenient to introduce the parameters "from" and "to" in the instance.

``` ruby
myEdge = ArangoDocument.new from: myDocA, to: myDocB
```

where myDocA and myDocB are the IDs of two Documents or are two ArangoDocument instances.
During the instance, it is possible to define a Body for the Document.

``` ruby
myDocument = ArangoDocument.new body: {"value" => 17}
```

<a name="create_doc"></a>
### Create one or more Documents

ArangoRB provides several way to create a single Document.

``` ruby
myDocument.create
myCollection.create_document document: myDocument # myDocument is an ArangoDocument instance or a Hash
ArangoDocument.create body: {"value" => 17}, collection: myDocument
```

Or more Documents.

``` ruby
myCollection.create_document document: [myDocumentA, myDocumentB, {"value" => 17}] # Array of ArangoDocument instances and Hashes
ArangoDocument.create body: [myDocumentA, {"value" => 18}, {"value" => 3}], collection: myDocument  # Array of ArangoDocument instances and Hash
```

### Create one or more Edges

ArangoRB has different way to create one or multiple edges. Here some example:

``` ruby
myEdge = ArangoDocument.new from: myDocA, to: myDocB; myEdge.create
myEdge.create_edge from: myDocA, to: myDocB # myDocA and myDocB are ArangoDocument ids or ArangoDocument instances
myEdgeCollection.create_edge document: myEdge, from: myDocA, to: myDocB
ArangoDocument.create_edge body: {"value" => 17}, from: myDocA, to: myDocB, collection: myEdgeCollection
```

Further we have the possibility to create different combination of Edges in only one line of code

One-to-one with one Edge class

 * [myDocA] --(myEdge)--> [myDocB]

``` ruby
myEdgeCollection.create_edge document: myEdge, from: myDocA, to: myDocB
```

One-to-more with one Edge class (and More-to-one with one Edge class)

 * [myDocA] --(myEdge)--> [myDocB]
 * [myDocA] --(myEdge)--> [myDocC]

 ``` ruby
myEdgeCollection.create_edge document: myEdge, from: myDocA, to: [myDocB, myDocC]
```

More-to-More with one Edge class

 * [myDocA] --(myEdge)--> [myDocC]
 * [myDocB] --(myEdge)--> [myDocC]
 * [myDocA] --(myEdge)--> [myDocD]
 * [myDocB] --(myEdge)--> [myDocD]

 ``` ruby
myEdgeCollection.create_edge document: myEdge, from: [myDocA, myDocB], to: [myDocC, myDocD]
```

More-to-More with more Edge classes

 * [myDocA] --(myEdge)--> [myDocC]
 * [myDocB] --(myEdge)--> [myDocC]
 * [myDocA] --(myEdge)--> [myDocD]
 * [myDocB] --(myEdge)--> [myDocD]
 * [myDocA] --(myEdge2)--> [myDocC]
 * [myDocB] --(myEdge2)--> [myDocC]
 * [myDocA] --(myEdge2)--> [myDocD]
 * [myDocB] --(myEdge2)--> [myDocD]

 ``` ruby
myEdgeCollection.create_edge document: [myEdge, myEdge2], from: [myDocA, myDocB], to: [myDocC, myDocD]
```

### Destroy a Document

``` ruby
myDocument.destroy
```

### Retrieve information

``` ruby
myDocument.retrieve # Retrieve Document
myDocument.collection # Retrieve Collection of the Document
myDocument.database # Retrieve Database of the Document
myDocument.retrieve_edges collection: myEdgeCollection  # Retrieve all myEdgeCollection edges connected with the Document
myDocument.any(myEdgeCollection) # Retrieve all myEdgeCollection edges connected with the Document
myDocument.in(myEdgeCollection)  # Retrieve all myEdgeCollection edges coming in the Document
myDocument.out(myEdgeCollection) # Retrieve all myEdgeCollection edges going out the Document
myEdge.from # Retrieve the document at the begin of the edge
myEdge.to # Retrieve the document at the end of the edge
```

#### Example: how to navigate the edges

Think for example that we have the following schema:
 * A --[class: a, name: aa]--> B
 * A --[class: a, name: bb]--> C
 * A --[class: b, name: cc]--> D
 * B --[class: a, name: dd]--> E

Then we have:

 * A.retrieve is A
 * A.retrieve_edges(collection: a) is [aa, bb]
 * B.any(a) is [aa, dd]
 * B.in(a) is [aa]
 * B.out(a) is [dd]
 * aa.from is A
 * aa.to is B

We can even do some combinations: for example A.out(a)[0].to.out(a)[0].to is E since:
 * A.out(a) is [aa]
 * A.out(a)[0] is aa
 * A.out(a)[0].to is B
 * A.out(a)[0].to.out(a) is [dd]
 * A.out(a)[0].to.out(a)[0] is dd
 * A.out(a)[0].to.out(a)[0].to is E

### Modify

``` ruby
myDocument.update body: {"value" => 3} # We update or add a value
myDocument.replace body: {"value" => 3} # We replace a value
```

<a name="ArangoGraph"></a>
## ArangoGraph

ArangoGraph are used to manage Graphs. You can create an ArangoGraph instance in one of the following way.

``` ruby
myGraph = ArangoGraph.new database: "MyDatabase", graph: "MyGraph"
myGraph = ArangoGraph.new graph: "MyGraph" # By using the default Database
myGraph = ArangoGraph.new # By using the defauly Database and Graph
```

### Create, Retrieve and Destroy a Graph

``` ruby
myGraph.create # create a new Graph
myGraph.retrieve # retrieve the Graph
myGraph.database # retrieve database of the Graph
myGraph.destroy # destroy the Graph
```

### Manage Vertex Collections

``` ruby
myGraph.vertexCollections # Retrieve all the vertexCollections of the Graph
myGraph.addVertexCollection collection: "myCollection"  # Add a Vertex Collection to our Graph
myGraph.removeVertexCollection collection: "myCollection"  # Remove a Vertex Collection to our Graph
```

### Manage Edge Collections

``` ruby
myGraph.edgeCollections # Retrieve all the edgeCollections of the Graph
myGraph.addEdgeCollections collection: "myEdgeCollection", from: "myCollectionA", to: "myCollectionB"  # Add an Edge Collection to our Graph
myGraph.replaceEdgeCollections collection: "myEdgeCollection", from: "myCollectionA", to: "myCollectionB"  # Replace an Edge Collection to our Graph
myGraph.removeEdgeCollections collection: "myEdgeCollection"  # Remove an Edge Collection to our Graph
```

<a name="ArangoVertex"></a><a name="ArangoEdge"></a>
## ArangoVertex and ArangoEdge

Both these two classes inherit the class ArangoDocument.
These two classes have been created since ArangoDatabase offers, in connection of the chosen graph, different HTTP requests to manage Vertexes and Edges. We recommend the reader to read carefully the section on [ArangoDocument instances](#ArangoDocument) before to start to use ArangoVertex and ArangoEdge instances.

### ArangoVertex methods

ArangoVertex inherit all the methods of ArangoDocument class. The following one works similar to the one of ArangoDocument Class but use different HTTP requests. For this reason the performance could be different.
To use ArangoVertex, the Collection of the Vertex needs to be added either to the VertexCollections or to the EdgeCollections of the chosen Graph.

``` ruby
myVertex = ArangoVertex.new key: "newVertex", body: {"value" => 3}, collection: "myCollection", graph: "myGraph", database: "myDatabase" # create a new instance
myVertex.create # create a new Document in the Graph
myVertex.retrieve  # retrieve a Document
myVertex.graph # Retrieve Graph  of the Document
myVertex.replace body: {"value" => 6} # replace the Document
myVertex.update body: {"value" => 6} # update the Document
myVertex.destroy # delete the Document
```

### ArangoEdge methods

ArangoEdge inherit all the methods of ArangoDocument class. The following one works similar to the one of ArangoDocument Class but use a different HTTP request. For this reason the performance could be different.
To use ArangoEdge, the Collection of the Edge needs to be added to the EdgeCollections of the chosen Graph.

``` ruby
myEdge = ArangoEdge.new key: "newVertex", body: {"value" => 3}, from: myArangoDocument, to: myArangoDocument, collection: "myCollection", graph: "myGraph", database: "myDatabase" # create a new instance
myEdge.create # create a new Document of type Edge in the Graph
myEdge.retrieve # retrieve a Document
myEdge.graph # Retrieve Graph  of the Document
myEdge.replace body: {"value" => 6} # replace the Document
myEdge.update body: {"value" => 6} # update the Document
myEdge.destroy # delete the Document
```

<a name="ArangoTraversal"></a>
## ArangoTraversal

ArangoTraversal is used to administrate the traversals.
ArangoTraversal needs to know the vertex from where the traversal starts, the direction the traversal is going and either the Graph or the EdgeCollection we want to analize.

``` ruby
myTraversal = ArangoTraversal.new # create new ArangoTraversal
myTraversal.vertex = myVertex # define starting Vertex
myTraversal.graph = myGraph  # define used Graph
myTraversal.edgeCollection = myEdgeCollection # define used Edge
myTraversal.in # Direction is in
myTraversal.out  # Direction is out
myTraversal.any  # Direction is in and out
myTraversal.min = 1 # Define how minimum deep we want to go with the traversal
myTraversal.max = 3 # Define how maximum deep we want to go with the traversal
```

After the traversal is setup, you can execute it:

``` ruby
myTraversal.execute
```

<a name="arangoaql"></a>
## ArangoAQL - ArangoDatabase Query Language

ArangoAQL is used to manage the ArangoDB query language. To instantiate a query

``` ruby
myQuery = ArangoAQL.new query: "FOR v,e,p IN 1..6 ANY 'Year/2016' GRAPH 'MyGraph' FILTER p.vertices[1].num == 6 && p.vertices[2].num == 22 && p.vertices[6]._key == '424028e5-e429-4885-b50b-007867208c71' RETURN [p.vertices[4].value, p.vertices[5].data]"
```

To execute it use:
``` ruby
myQuery.execute
```

If the query is too big, you can divide the fetching in pieces, for example:
``` ruby
myQuery.size = 10
myQuery.execute # First 10 documents
myQuery.next # Next 10 documents
myQuery.next # Next 10 documents
```

### Check property query

``` ruby
myQuery.explain # Show data query
myQuery.parse # Parse query
myQuery.properties;  # Check properties
myQuery.current; # Retrieve current Query
myQuery.slow; # Retrieve slow Queries
myQuery.changeProperties maxSlowQueries: 65 # Change Properties
```

### Delete query

``` ruby
myQuery.stopSlow; # Stop Slow query
myQuery.kill; # Kill Query
```

<a name="ArangoUser"></a>
## ArangoUser

ArangoUser manages the users.
To initialize an user:

``` ruby
myUser = ArangoUser.new user: "MyUser", password: "password"
```

### User management

``` ruby
myUser.retrieve # Retrieve User
myUser["MyDatabase"] # Retrieve database if the user can access it
myUser.create # Create a new User
myUser.replace active: false # Replace User
myUser.update active: false # Update User
myUser.destroy # Delete User
```

### Database management

``` ruby
myUser.databases # Check permission Databases
myUser.grant database: "MyDatabase" # Grant access to a database
myUser.revoke database: "MyDatabase" # Revoke access to a database
```

<a name="ArangoIndex"></a>
## ArangoIndex

ArangoIndex manages the indexes.
To initialize an index:

``` ruby
myIndex = ArangoIndex.new fields: "num", unique: false, id: "myIndex"
```

### Index management

``` ruby
myIndex.retrieve # Retrieve Index
myIndex.create # Create a new Index
ArangoIndex.indexes collection: "MyCollection" # List indexes
myIndex.destroy # Delete Index
```

Alternatively, you can create an Index of a Collection directly from its Collection.

``` ruby
myCollection.createIndex unique: false, fields: "num", type: "hash"
```

<a name="ArangoTransaction"></a>
## ArangoTransaction

Transactions are managed by ArangoTransaction. This class has only initialization and execution.

``` ruby
myArangoTransaction = ArangoTransaction.new action: "function(){ var db = require('@arangodb').db; db.MyCollection.save({}); return db.MyCollection.count(); }", write: myCollection # Or read
myArangoTransaction.execute # Return the result of the execution
```

## ArangoTask

Tasks are managed by ArangoTask.

``` ruby
myArangoTask = ArangoTask.new id: "mytaskid", name: "MyTaskID", command: "(function(params) { require('@arangodb').print(params); })(params)", params: {"foo" => "bar", "bar" => "foo"}, period: 2 # Initialize a  Task Instance that will be alive for 2 seconds
myArangoTask.create # Create a new Task
ArangoTask.tasks # Retrieve a list of active tasks
myArangoTask.retrieve # Retrieve a Task
myArangoTask.destroy # Delete a Task
```

## ArangoCache

ArangoCache helps you to manage your request to your Database by creating a cache.

``` ruby
myQuery = ArangoAQL.new query: "FOR v,e,p IN 1..6 ANY 'Year/2016' GRAPH 'MyGraph' FILTER p.vertices[1].num == 6 && p.vertices[2].num == 22 && p.vertices[6]._key == '424028e5-e429-4885-b50b-007867208c71' RETURN [p.vertices[4].value, p.vertices[5].data]"
myQuery.execute # Heavy computation
ArangoCache.cache data: myQuery # Cache these heavy query
ArangoCache.uncache data: myQuery # Retrieve cached ArangoAQL with same query request
ArangoCache.clear data: myQuery # Free the cache from these three documents
ArangoCache.clear type: "AQL" # Delete cache from AQL requests
ArangoCache.clear # Clear completely all the cache
```

Alternatively we can save, retrieve and delete multiple values

``` ruby
myQuery = ArangoAQL.new query: "FOR v,e,p IN 1..6 ANY 'Year/2016' GRAPH 'MyGraph' FILTER p.vertices[1].num == 6 && p.vertices[2].num == 22 && p.vertices[6]._key == '424028e5-e429-4885-b50b-007867208c71' RETURN [p.vertices[4].value, p.vertices[5].data]"
myQuery2 = ArangoAQL.new query: "FOR u IN Hour FILTER u._key == "2016-10-04T23" RETURN u"
myQuery.execute # Heavy computation
myQuery2.execute
ArangoCache.cache data: [myQuery, myQuery2] # Cache these heavy query
ArangoCache.uncache data: [myQuery, myQuery2] # Retrieve cached ArangoAQL
ArangoCache.clear data: [myQuery, myQuery2] # Free the cache from these request
```

If we need we can save with personalized ID.

``` ruby
ArangoCache.cache id: ["myFirstQuery", "mySecondQuery"] data: [myQuery, myQuery2] # Cache these heavy query
ArangoCache.uncache type: "AQL", id: ["myFirstQuery", "mySecondQuery"] # Retrieve cached ArangoAQL
ArangoCache.clear type: "AQL", id: ["myFirstQuery", "mySecondQuery"] # Free the cache from these request
```

The type and the quantity that you can save in the cache are the following: Database: 1, Collection: 20, Document: 200, Graph: 1, Vertex: 50, Edge: 100, Index: 20, AQL: 100, User: 50, Task: 20, Traversal: 20, Transaction: 20, Other: 100. For "Other" we mean all the values that are not included in the other categories.

To modify these limitations you can use the following command:
``` ruby
ArangoCache.max type: "Document", val: 100 # Change limits Document
```
NB: If you insert a max value higher than the quantity of elements in the Cache, then the first elements in excess will be removed from the Cache.

If the limit of the Cache for one type is reached, then the first element cached of that type will be deleted from the Cache.

## Replication

Replication is useful to create back up copy of your database or to have a master-slave relationship between two databases.

Remember: the used database is the one where the data will be written (the slave) and the remote database will be the master one.

Use with caution since the data in the slave database will be deleted.

To setup our Slave Server and Master Database use a similar command.

``` ruby
ArangoServer.default_server user: "root", password: "tretretre", server: "172.17.8.101", port: "8529" # Our Slave Server
myReplication = ArangoReplication.new endpoint: "tcp://10.10.1.97:8529", username: "root", password: "", database: "year" # Our Master Database
```

Than to do a simple syncronization uses;

``` ruby
myReplication.sync
```

To retrieve some information ArangoRB provides the following methods:

``` ruby
myDatabase = ArangoDatabase.new database: "year"
myCollection = myDatabase["MyCollection"]
myDatabase.inventory # Fetch Collection data
myCollection.dump # Fetch all the data in one class from one tick to another
myReplication.logger # Returns the current state of the server's replication logger
myReplication.loggerFollow # Returns data from the server's replication log.
myReplication.firstTick # Return the first available tick value from the server
myReplication.rangeTick # Returns the currently available ranges of tick values for all currently available WAL logfiles.
myReplication.serverId # Returns the servers id.
```

### Relation Master-Slave

To enslave a Server in relation to another Database use the following command:

``` ruby
myReplication.enslave
```

To manage the Configuration of a Master-Slave Replication you can use the following commands:

``` ruby
myReplication.configurationReplication # check the Configuration of the Replication
myReplication.stateReplication # check the status of the Replication
myReplication.stopReplication # stop the Replication
myReplication.modifyReplication  # modify the Configuration of the Replication (you can modify only a stopped Replication)
myReplication.startReplication # restart the replication
```
